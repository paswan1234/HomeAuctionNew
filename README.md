# Workflows : Guide

Like as maintaing code is necessary. The is also need of maintaining our GIT & it's branches. Therefore, we require an workflow guide to maintaing this as follows:

- Take an pull from `develop` branch

```bash
$ git fetch origin develop
$ git checkout develop
$ git pull origin develop
$ npm i
```

- **How To Create Branch?** : Let's assume you wanted to work on adding an feature to add an new page to routes named as : **`add-new-page`**. Then your branch's name would be **`feature/add-new-page`**. Thus you will follows:

```bash
/// DO Above Step First Everytime
$ git checkout develop // Run This only when you are not on develop branch
$ git pull origin develop // Always sync with remote
$ git checkout -b feature/add-new-page
```

-> Cheers you have now your own _feature branch_. !!!

- **What to do after adding feature?** : Now when you have done your work. It's time to add & commit & push changes. Thus you will follow:

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "madhav added new page"
/// After this Pre-Commit Hook will be triggered and will verify your code.
/// Once Your commit is made up
$ git push origin feature/add-new-page // your branch name
```

So now finally your branch is on remote origin.

- **What's Next** : Now the Last and Remaining Tasks left is raising PR (Pull Request).
